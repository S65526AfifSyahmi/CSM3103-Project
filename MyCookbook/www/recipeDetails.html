                    <br>
                    This strawberry Oreo cheesecake is what dreams are made of! A decadent, smooth, creamy filling sits atop a dark, chocolaty Oreo cookie crust, and gets punctuated with bright notes of sweet-tart strawberries. Give yourself plenty of time to make this—it requires at least 8 hours of chill time.

                        <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Strawberry sauce: Place strawberries, sugar, lemon juice, and salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring often, until strawberries soften and release their juices, about 10 minutes.

                            <br>
                            <li>Stir water and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Add cornstarch mixture to strawberries, and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to thicken, 1 to 2 minutes more. Remove from heat, and carefully pour mixture through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl; use the back of a wooden spoon or spatula to press out as much juice as possible. Discard pulp. Place strawberry sauce, uncovered, into the refrigerator to cool.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Oreo crust: Combine cookie crumbs, brown sugar, and salt. Stir in melted butter until thoroughly combined. Press mixture evenly into the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of the prepared pan. Place pan on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Bake crust in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, leaving oven on, and allow to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Cheesecake filling: Beat cream cheese and sugar until thoroughly smooth and combined. Add in heavy cream, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, almond extract, and nutmeg; beat on low speed until smooth. Add in eggs, and beat on low speed just until eggs are incorporated.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Pour half of filling into crust. Drizzle 6 tablespoons of cooled strawberry sauce over filling. Pour remaining filling into the pan, taking care to cover strawberry sauce. Reserve remaining strawberry sauce, covered, in the refrigerator until ready to serve the cheesecake.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Return cheesecake to the oven and bake until the top looks set, and edges are beginning to turn golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Turn oven off, prop the door slightly ajar, and leave cheesecake to cool in the oven for 1 hour.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Remove cheesecake to a wire rack. Run a knife around the top edge of cheesecake to loosen it slightly from the pan; allow to cool in the pan to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>When ready to serve, toss halved strawberries into reserved strawberry sauce until thoroughly coated. Remove cheesecake from springform pan; place on a serving platter. Pour strawberries and sauce on top of the cake, and turn all the berries cut-side-down. Garnish with halved Oreos, if desired. Keep extra cheesecake stored in the fridge.</li>
